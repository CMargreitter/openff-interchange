`PEP440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#final-releases>`_, where

* ``major`` increments denote a change that may break API compatibility with previous ``major`` releases
* ``minor`` increments add features but do not break API compatibility
* ``micro`` increments represent bugfix releases or improvements in documentation

Please note that all releases prior to a version 1.0.0 are considered pre-releases and many API changes will come before a stable release.
