Jupyter notebooks demonstrating use cases.

  * `SMIRNOFF_simulation.ipynb`: Runs an MD simulation from a PDB file and `openff-1.0.0` ("Parsley"), mirroring a similar example in the Open Force Field Toolkit (`openforcefield`)
  * `smirnoff_argon.ipynb`: Loads a simple Argon topology and inspects some internal data.
  * `smirnoff_ethanol.ipynb`: Similar to above but with a more chemically complex system.
